**Linux Users**

*Short version*
0) Program KCU105 with project bitfile and plug into machine in PCIe slot
1) Use kernel version 4.15.0-91-generic on host machine
2) Install all packages in setup_notes/installed_packages.txt
3) make Linux-PCIe-DMA-Driver/XDMA/linux-kernel/xdma/Makefile
4) run Linux-PCIe-DMA-Driver/XDMA/linux-kernel/tests/load_driver.sh
5) start using Linux-PCIe-DMA-Driver/XDMA/linux-kernel/tools/dma_from_device
and dma_to_device to perform transfers of your data to the various
memory-mapped peripherals. 

*Long version*

First and foremost, before trying to set up this Xilinx DMA system,
ensure that you are using a compatible kernel version
(4.15.0-91-generic works out-of-box or see the file 
"other_setup_instructions.txt" for more info if not possible).  
This can be checked with the command $uname -r, and installed kernel
versions can be shown with the command $dpkg -l | grep linux-image.

If you are running into problems getting the right kernel image to
boot (my grub would not detect my keyboard for instance) follow
instructions here:
https://askubuntu.com/questions/216398/set-older-kernel-as-default-grub-entry

Once you have made sure that you have a working kernel version, go ahead and
install all the packages in install_packages.txt via 
$sudo apt install $(cat installed_packages.txt)

Once that has finished, navigate to (FPGA_API/Linux-PCIe-DMA-Driver/
XDMA/linux-kernel/xdma) and make the makefile there.  If that goes off
without a hitch, you're in business.  If it doesn't, figure out why and come
back later.

Once the makefile has been run, navigate up one directory to tests and 
(set executable and) run the "load_driver.sh" file.  Again, this should give
the exact message:
Loading xdma driver...
Error: The Kernel module installed correctly, but no devices were recognized.
 FAILED
This is good. (FPGA setup is the next section).

If this did not work then something went wrong with the driver install in the
preceding paragraphs.
