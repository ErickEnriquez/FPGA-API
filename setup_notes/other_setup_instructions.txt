-The Xilinx DMA kernel driver is very finicky and will only work with very
specific kernel versions.
	-Versions past 4.18.0-15.16 seem to run into errors with functions 
	being removed from the kernel lexicon and numbers of params.
	-kernel Version 4.15.0-91-generic works right out of the box

-If using this verion of the kernel is not possible, you can go all the way
up to kernel version 5.0.0-29 with the following:

Versions past 5.3.0-42-generic give errors about functions missing such as
mmiowb, which stop the compilation of the kernel driver.
