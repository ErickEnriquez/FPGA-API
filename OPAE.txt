The Open Programmable Acceleration Engine is a software framework for managing and accessing programmable accelerators (FPGAs). Its main parts are:

- The OPAE Software Development Kit (OPAE SDK),
- The OPAE Linux driver for Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU with Integrated FPGAs and Intel(R) PAC with Arria(R) 10 GX FPGA
- The Basic Building Block (BBB) library for accelerating AFU development (not part of the OPAE release, but pre-release code is available on GitHub: Intel FPGA BBB

It provides a library implementing the OPAE C API for presenting a streamlined and easy-to-use interface for software applications to discover, access, and manage FPGA devices and accelerators using the OPAE software stack.

The OPAE SDK also includes the AFU Simulation Environment (ASE) for end-to-end simulation of accelerator RTL together with software applications using the OPAE C API. OPAE's goal is to accelerate FPGA adoption.
